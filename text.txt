Perfect. This is exactly the right way to approach DSA at your stage:
👉 small dose, very focused, immediately actionable.

I’ll do this in 3 tight sections:
	1.	Minimal learning material (arrays + hash maps in Python)
	2.	Mental models you must remember (this matters more than syntax)
	3.	Your exact task: 4 EASY problems (2 arrays + 2 hash maps) with clear instructions

No overload. This should take ~2–2.5 hours total.

⸻

1️⃣ Minimal Learning Material (ONLY what you need)

A. Arrays in Python (Lists)

What an array means in interviews

In LeetCode / interviews:
	•	“Array” = Python list
	•	Focus is on:
	•	traversal
	•	indexing
	•	ordering
	•	using extra space wisely

Python basics you MUST know

arr = [1, 2, 3]

arr.append(4)
arr[0]        # first element
len(arr)
for x in arr:
    print(x)

for i in range(len(arr)):
    print(arr[i])

Common array patterns (VERY IMPORTANT)
	•	Scan once (O(n))
	•	Two pointers
	•	Build new array
	•	Modify in place

📘 Learning material (read only this page)
👉 https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/

You do not need tuples now. Focus on lists.

⸻

B. Hash Maps in Python (Dictionaries)

What a hash map means

Hash map = dictionary
Used when you need:
	•	fast lookup
	•	counting
	•	remembering what you’ve seen before

Python basics you MUST know

mp = {}

mp["a"] = 1
mp["a"] += 1

if "a" in mp:
    print(mp["a"])

for key, value in mp.items():
    print(key, value)

Counting pattern (this appears everywhere)

counts = {}
for x in arr:
    counts[x] = counts.get(x, 0) + 1

2️⃣ Mental Models (Memorize These)

This is more important than solving many problems.

🧠 Array → think:

“I can scan left to right”

Ask yourself:
	•	Do I need order?
	•	Can I solve in one pass?
	•	Can I use two pointers?

⸻

🧠 Hash Map → think:

“I want to remember something I saw before”

Ask yourself:
	•	Do I need fast lookup?
	•	Am I counting?
	•	Am I checking existence?

If the problem says:
	•	“find pair”
	•	“check duplicates”
	•	“frequency”
	•	“first time”
→ Hash map immediately

3️⃣ Your TASK: 4 Easy Problems (Do in this order)

Create a folder:

dsa/
  arrays.py
  hashmaps.py

Solve exactly these 4 problems.

⸻

🟦 ARRAY PROBLEM 1 (Easy)

Problem: Maximum Number in Array

Task
Given a list of integers, return the maximum value.

Example:

nums = [3, 7, 2, 9, 4]
# Output: 9

Rules
	•	Do NOT use max() (important)
	•	Use a loop

What this tests
	•	Traversal
	•	Comparison logic

⸻

🟦 ARRAY PROBLEM 2 (Easy)

Problem: Remove Duplicates (Preserve Order)

Task
Given a list, return a new list with duplicates removed while keeping order.

Example:

nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4]
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Hint
	•	Use an extra list
	•	Use in check

What this tests
	•	Array traversal
	•	Order preservation

⸻

🟩 HASH MAP PROBLEM 1 (Easy)

Problem: Frequency Count

Task
Given a list of numbers, return a dictionary of counts.

Example:

nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
# Output: {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}

Rules
	•	Use dictionary
	•	Use .get()

What this tests
	•	Counting pattern (VERY important)

⸻

🟩 HASH MAP PROBLEM 2 (Classic Easy)

Problem: Two Sum (Easy version)

Task
Given a list and a target, return True if any two numbers sum to target.

Example:

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
# Output: True

Hint
	•	Use a dictionary or set
	•	Check target - current

What this tests
	•	Hash map lookup
	•	Thinking in complements

⸻

⏱ Suggested Time Split

Activity	Time
Reading (arrays + dicts)	30–40 min
Array problems (2)	40–50 min
Hash map problems (2)	40–50 min
Review & cleanup	15 min

Total ≈ 2–2.5 hours

⸻

✅ Done Checklist (Important)

You are DONE with this task when:
	•	You solved all 4 without looking at solutions
	•	You understand why hash map was used
	•	You can explain your solution out loud
	•	Code runs without errors

⸻

🚫 Very Important (Mindset)

Do NOT:
	•	Optimize prematurely
	•	Worry about time complexity formulas
	•	Compare yourself to competitive programmers

At your level:

Clarity > speed

⸻

Next step (after you finish)

Reply with one of these:
	•	“Solved arrays, stuck on hash maps”
	•	“Solved all 4, please review my Two Sum logic”
	•	“Ready for next DSA pattern”

I’ll then move you to the next most useful pattern (strings or sliding window), keeping the same low-friction style.
